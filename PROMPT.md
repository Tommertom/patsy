Act as a senior brand designer and create a fresh logo concept + color palette for this product:

Product: Patsy
Purpose: A lightweight web app that securely stores private access tokens behind a 6-digit code, encrypts data locally in the browser, and keeps user data on-device (privacy-first, no backend required for core use).
Brand personality: trustworthy, calm, privacy-focused, modern, practical, and developer-friendly.

Requirements:
1) Create 3 logo directions for "Patsy" (wordmark + icon ideas), suitable for web favicon, app header banner, and social preview.
2) Include visual symbolism related to secure storage, privacy, local control, and quick token access (avoid generic padlock-only clichés).
3) Provide one final recommended direction and explain why.
4) Produce a complete UI color palette with named tokens and HEX codes:
   - background
   - surface/card
   - primary
   - primary-hover
   - secondary/accent
   - success
   - warning
   - danger
   - text-primary
   - text-secondary
   - border
5) Ensure accessibility: at least AA contrast for normal body text on background/surface combinations.

Critical color constraint:
- The current app uses purple/indigo tones (examples: #667EEA, #764BA2, #6E34CF).
- DO NOT use purple, indigo, violet, or close neighboring hues.
- The new scheme must be clearly different; prefer a distinct direction such as teal + amber + slate, or another non-purple system.

Output format:
- Section A: 3 logo concepts (name + rationale + where it works best)
- Section B: final recommended logo concept (with 1 short tagline option)
- Section C: full palette table (token, hex, usage)
- Section D: quick CSS variable block (:root) with the final tokens
- Section E: brief guidance for adapting the logo/palette to light and dark UI modes
